📌 Project: MAUIRILLO

This project was developed as a group assignment for the Higher vocational education in Cross-platform application development.
It is a .NET cross-platform application inspired in the game Pinturillo.

👥 Team Project

This was a collaborative effort where each team member contributed to every part of the project development.
This repository is a personal copy of the original project hosted in another teammate’s GitHub account, so it does not reflect the complete commit history or contribution timeline of the group.

The original repository is in an account that will be deleted someday between 2026 and 2027.
